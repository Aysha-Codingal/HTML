Majeediyya School was founded in April 19, 1927, under the name Madhrasathul Salaahiyyaa.[4] The school name was changed to Madhrasathul Saniyyathul Hukoomathul Mahaldheebiyya in 1928. The first principal of the school was Husain Salahuddin. Mohamed Amin Didi was Principal from 1946 to 1953[5] and it was during this time that the school was renamed Madhrasathul Majeediyya. The first GCE O Level started in 1962.[3] The school started providing coeducation in 2011 and had its second enrollment of grade 1 students.[3] There has been some concerns over conditions of the school in the years such as in 2018, where teachers protested over altercations, as well as recently in 2024, where the bridge connecting the old building and the new building has seen cracks come up.</p>
