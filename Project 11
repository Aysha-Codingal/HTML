           I have many bestfriends. But the most I like to have as a bestfriend is Ailyn. She is a very kind girl. She is sooooo hilarious. Ailyn always helps me with my school works. She is the first bestfriend i got in grade 6. But now onwards i will never ever forget her in my life. I love Ailyn soooooo much.❤❤❤❤
